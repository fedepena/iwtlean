- Intro

    Thanks for your interest in the **I Will Teach You To Be Lean** program to lose weight

    This is a quick survey to get the contact details to send you the program's information (just name and email) and to establish a baseline in case you decide to go ahead with the program - it should take about 2-3 minutes to complete

- Question 1

    What is your first name?

- Question 2

    What email do you want me to send the program information to?

    I will use it only for that purpose and you will not hear again from me again unless you respond

- Question 3

    What is your current weight?

- Question 4

    What is your height?

- Question 5

    What is your ideal/target weight?

- Thank you message

    Thanks for completing the survey **first-name**

    An email from me with the program's information should be on your inbox now (or shortly). Please check your spam folder if you don't see it.
