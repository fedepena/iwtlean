    Hi *First Name*

    Thanks for your interest in the I Will Teach You To Be Lean program to lose weight by cutting down on bad food.

    **Basic information about the program**

    I Will Teach You To Be Lean is a 12-week program designed to help you reduce substantially your bad food intake with a minimum effort.

    Minimum doesn’t mean effortless: you will have to do a few things, but they don’t involve elaborated meal plans or require grandiose levels of willpower.

    My goal is to help you crowd out the bad stuff so that you start noticing and enjoying the many benefits of real, good food, including weight loss.

    If you decide to go ahead, you will pay me $399 to be your eating coach, cheerleader and accountability partner for 12 weeks.

    During those 12 weeks, we will have a virtual meeting of up to 40 minutes each week plus ongoing communication via WhatsApp and/or email.

    My hope is that by the end of those 12 weeks you won’t need my help any more to stay on a new course that would be highly beneficial for your health and well-being.

    You can pay me only $99 of the fee upfront and the rest after successfully completing the program (i.e., when you are happy with the results).

    I'm prepared to put most of my fee at risk because I have confidence in the results of the program, but I have no control over you doing what is needed to succeed, so I need you to have some skin in the game by paying $99 upfront and knowing it’s not refundable.

    **Who am I and why should you trust me?**

    I’m an entrepreneur and the father of a 7-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl. I was born in Bogotá, Colombia but live in Wellington, New Zealand.

    I have a software as a service business ([myabakus.com](http://myabakus.com/)) and the I Will Teach To Be Lean program is a side business/project for me.

    I decided to start it because I believe it can have a very positive impact on the people who follow it and carry on with the lifestyle adjustments introduced during the program.

    I'm practicing what I'm preaching: the program is based on what I do myself regularly and I expect you to reap the same benefits I've had.

    I’m not a nutrition expert (and given the dismal record of most nutrition advice I will argue that it is a good thing), but I've been fortunate enough to have excellent health and maintain the same weight throughout all my adult life.

    I'm happy to go on a video call with you to discuss the program and answer all the questions you might have, but you first need to pay a $9 **refundable** deposit. This is to make sure you are genuinely interested and to avoid wasting time with someone who really isn't.

    If after talking to me, you feel that the program is not going to work for you, I will refund the $9 right away.

    And if you want to go ahead, all you have to do is send $90 to complete the $99 investment needed to get started with the program.

    I want to emphasize that this is not an information product nor a productized service. This is a new and exciting side project for me in which I will be working one-on-one with you. And although I cannot guarantee success, I can promise I will do my best to help you get the results we want. After all, my success with this program will entirely depend on yours.
