    Hi *First Name*

    Thanks for your interest in the I Will Teach You To Be Lean program to lose weight by cutting down on bad food.

    **Basic information about the program**

    I Will Teach You To Be Lean is a 10-week program designed to help you reduce substantially your bad food intake with a minimum effort.

    Minimum doesn’t mean effortless: you will have to do a few things, but they don’t involve elaborated meal plans or require grandiose levels of willpower.

    My goal is to help you crowd out the bad stuff so that you start noticing and enjoying the many benefits of real, good food, including weight loss.

    If you decide to go ahead, you will pay me U$350 to be your eating coach, cheerleader and accountability partner for 10 weeks.

    During those 10 weeks, we will have a virtual meeting of 30 minutes each week plus ongoing communication via WhatsApp and/or email.

    My hope is that by the end of those 10 weeks you won’t need my help any more to stay on a new course that would be highly beneficial for your health and well-being.

    You can pay me half of the fee upfront and the other half after successfully completing the program (i.e., when you are happy with the results).

    I'm prepared to put half of my fee at risk because I have confidence in the results of the program, but I have no control over you doing what is needed to succeed, so I need you to have some skin in the game by paying the other half upfront and knowing it’s not refundable.

    **Who am I and why should you trust me?**

    I’m an entrepreneur and the father of a 6-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl. I was born in Bogotá, Colombia but live in Wellington, New Zealand.

    I have software as a service business ([myabakus.com](http://myabakus.com/)) and the I Will Teach To Be Lean program is a side business/project for me.

    I decided to start it because I believe it can have a very positive impact on the people who follow it and carry on with the lifestyle adjustments introduced during the program.

    I'm practising what I'm preaching: the program is based on what I do myself regularly and I expect you to reap the same benefits I had.

    I’m not a nutrition expert (and given the dismal record of most nutrition advice I will argue that it is a good thing), but I've been fortunate enough to have excellent health and maintain the same weight throughout all my adult life.

    I'm happy to go on a video call with you to discuss the program and answer all the questions you might have, but you first need to pay a U$25 **refundable** deposit.

    If after talking to me you feel that the program is not going to work for you, I will refund the U$25 right away.

    And if you want to go ahead, all you have to do is send U$150 to complete half of the fee for the program, and we can get started right away.
